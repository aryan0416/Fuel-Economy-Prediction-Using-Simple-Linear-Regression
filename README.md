# Fuel Economy Prediction Using Simple Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of **Simple Linear Regression** to predict a car's fuel economy (**MPG - Miles Per Gallon**) based on its horsepower. The dataset contains fuel economy data for various cars, and we aim to build a predictive model using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Simple-Linear-Regression.git
cd Simple-Linear-Regression
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** and the required libraries installed. You can install dependencies using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Open Jupyter Notebook
```sh
jupyter notebook
```
Navigate to the `notebooks/` folder and open the `.ipynb` files to explore the project.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of:
- **Horse Power**: The engine power of the car
- **Fuel Economy (MPG)**: The fuel efficiency of the car

## 📈 Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
2. **Data Preprocessing**
3. **Building the Linear Regression Model**
4. **Evaluating the Model's Performance**

## 🏆 Results
The model predicts **MPG (Miles Per Gallon)** based on **Horse Power** with a simple linear regression approach. Performance metrics like **R² Score, MSE, and MAE** are used to evaluate the model.

## 🔥 Future Improvements
- Try multiple regression with more features
- Use polynomial regression for better accuracy
- Compare with advanced ML models (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Networks)
